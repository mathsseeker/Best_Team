# Best Team Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and select the best possible Spanish football team by identifying players with the highest performance statistics. Using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, the project evaluates player and team performance to build an optimal lineup for the Spanish national team.

## Features

- **Player Statistics Analysis**: Fetch and process detailed player statistics, including goals, assists, passing accuracy, defensive actions, and more.
- **Team Performance Evaluation**: Analyze team match statistics to identify key performance indicators.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use models like Random Forest and SMOTE to compute feature importance and handle imbalanced datasets.
- **Position-Based Player Ranking**: Rank players by position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Attacker) based on their computed ratings.
- **API Integration**: Fetch real-time data from football APIs for accurate and up-to-date statistics.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The project fetches player and team data using the Football API.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Player Evaluation**: Computes player ratings based on weighted metrics tailored to Spanish football.
4. **Team Selection**: Selects the top players for each position to form the best possible team.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning models and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Imbalanced-Learn**: For handling class imbalance in datasets.
- **Football API**: For fetching player and team statistics.
